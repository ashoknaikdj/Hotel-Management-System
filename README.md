# Hotel-Management-System
INTRODUCTION 
  With the mass gain in the development of economic and tourism, marketing in the hotel industries is at a great phase. Competition in these areas are becomes wider. They are continuously trying to meet the customer’s expectations and building their systems to attract interest of most of the customers. Keeping in mind about the type of service with low cost and full satisfaction is their first motive. 
Let us take a view to an ordinary hotel management system which is manually operated, the customer should present at the reception the make an entry of his/her personal information then a room is allotted to the person. The receptionist offers a key to the allotted room but here customer thinks about the privacy of information which he/she gave to the receptionist. The world's best hotels have always been on the lookout for them to evaluate, implement and improve hotel management information.

EXISTING SYSTEM
  This existing system of hotel management was manual. All the daily routines are carried out manually and the records are maintaining in the record books or the registers. As traditional menu cards are paper based, any changes that need to be made in the menu will require reprinting of the entire menu card, leading to wastage. For small changes, reprinting the entire menu cards is impossible. Changes in the menu card cannot be made dynamically. It is inefficient to access a particular record from the stack of papers. This system is consuming. One has to call a waiter number of times till he notices it, and wait for him to arrive at their table to take their order. Also the waiter can misinterpret the customers order since he is writing the order on paper, and case of serving a wrong dish is possible. So we wanted to upgrade hotel management system from manual to computerized system. As all the activities that happen in the hotel such as enquiry, check status booking order etc can be handled on this system simultaneously. By this we cannot loss data and data can be secured and we can access any time.

CONCLUSION 
Here the need for tablet food ordering is analyzed and its advantages over the traditional food ordering system in restaurants are studied. The proposed online restaurant management system is time saving and error free as compared to the traditional system. This system attracts customers and also adds the efficiency of maintaining the restaurant’s ordering and billing. Hence it is the modern way to grow up the business using E-commerce.This system entirely reduces the unnecessary time. Every order is associated with an individual seat at the table, and orders are built one customer at a time, just like on paper, but with greater accuracy. Items can also easily be shared by the whole table, moved or modified, and noted and the cost can be calculated in real time.
